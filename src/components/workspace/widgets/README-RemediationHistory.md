# Remediation History Widget

The Remediation History widget displays the actions taken by the Remediation Agent in response to data quality issues. It provides a historical record and real-time tracking of all automated and human-initiated remediation activities.

## Key Features

### Action Tracking
- Lists all remediation actions with status (Completed, Pending, Failed)
- Shows detailed information about each action
- Provides timeline visualization of the remediation process

### Filtering and Organization
- Filter actions by status (All, Completed, Pending, Failed)
- Sort by time, severity, or impact
- Group by type of remediation or data domain

### Action Details
For each remediation action, the widget shows:
- Title and description of the action
- What triggered the action (Data Quality Alert, User Request, Scheduled)
- Action taken (with technical details)
- Result and impact
- Execution time and affected records
- Timeline of the remediation process

### Integration with Data Quality Insights
- Shows which Data Quality alerts led to the remediation
- Connects user decisions to automated actions
- Provides an audit trail of the entire process

### Examples
- **Data Normalization**: Automatic correction of outlier values
- **Missing Value Imputation**: ML-based filling of missing data
- **Schema Correction**: Alignment of schema changes with documentation
- **Data Deduplication**: Removal of duplicate records
- **Field Type Correction**: Conversion of incorrectly formatted fields

### Workflow Integration
When a user selects a remediation action from the Data Quality Insights widget:
1. The Remediation History widget automatically opens
2. The selected action is highlighted
3. Real-time progress is shown for ongoing remediations
4. Results are displayed as they become available

## Use Cases
- Audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Performance tracking of automated remediation
- Identification of recurring data quality issues
- Evaluation of remediation effectiveness
- Planning for process improvements

This widget completes the end-to-end workflow from data quality detection through remediation, providing transparency and accountability for all automated actions.
