# Learning Agent Widget

## Overview
The Learning Agent Widget provides transparency into the AI learning processes that power the risk management system. It visualizes what data the system is learning from, how it's learning, and the performance metrics of the learning models, making AI decision-making more transparent and explainable.

## Features

### Learning Activity Monitoring
- Tracks all learning events and model updates
- Shows data sources being used for learning
- Displays learning types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
- Visualizes learning progress over time

### Model Performance Metrics
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score tracking
- Performance trend visualization over time
- Comparison between model versions
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty measures

### Data Source Transparency
- Lists all data sources used for model training
- Shows volume of data points processed
- Indicates data freshness and update frequency
- Highlights key features used in models

### Learning Insights
- Explains what patterns the AI has identified
- Shows how new knowledge is incorporated into models
- Visualizes key relationships discovered in data
- Highlights anomalies and outliers identified during learning

### Interactive Interface
- Tab-based navigation between different aspects (overview, data sources, metrics)
- Interactive charts for exploring performance metrics
- Timeline of learning events
- Detailed view of individual learning events

## Technical Implementation
- Subscribes to learning events through the message bus
- Uses recharts to visualize performance metrics and trends
- Implements tabbed interface for different aspects of learning
- Provides detailed view for specific learning events

## Integration with Other Components
- Receives data from the Learning Agent through the message bus
- Connects learning events with related data quality insights
- Shows how learning improves the system's ability to detect issues

## User Workflow
1. User receives notification about a completed learning event
2. User clicks on the notification, which adds this widget to the workspace
3. User can examine what the system has learned and from what data
4. User can verify model performance metrics
5. User can gain confidence in the AI's decision-making process through transparency
